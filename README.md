## 📤 How It Works
Fetches hourly forecast using OpenWeatherMap.

Checks for weather condition codes < 700 (indicating precipitation).

If rain is predicted:

      ✅ SMS: “It's going to rain today! ☔”

      ✅ WhatsApp: “It's going to rain today. Bring an umbrella ☔”

If clear:

      ✅ SMS: “It's not going to rain today ☀️”

      ✅ WhatsApp: “Enjoy your day, no rain expected ☀️”
